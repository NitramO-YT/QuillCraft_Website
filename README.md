# QuillCraft Website Repository

This repository is home to the codebase for the QuillCraft Minecraft server website. It's a work in progress, and its purpose is to support the development of the V2 of our website. Please keep in mind that this README isn't a literary masterpiece; it's a simple guide to help us collaborate effectively on this project.

## Purpose and Workflow

1. **Long-term Development**: This repository will be active throughout the development of V2 of our website. We'll use GitHub Actions to handle various automated tasks. Once V2 is complete, we'll deploy it to the VPS currently hosting V1 at quillcraft.fr.

2. **Contributing**: To work on this project, please follow these steps:

    a. **Fork**: Start by forking this repository to your GitHub account.

    b. **Local Work**: Clone your fork to your local development environment. Work on your changes there.

    c. **Sync with Upstream**: Before you start working each time, make sure to sync your fork with the main repository to fetch any updates made by others.

    d. **Branches**: Avoid working directly on the main branch of your fork, if possible. Create and work on secondary branches for your changes.

    e. **Pull Request**: When your changes are ready, push them to your fork on GitHub and open a pull request (PR) to the main repository.

    f. **Review and Merge**: An admin will review your PR and, if everything looks good, merge it into the main branch.

By following this workflow, we aim to minimize interference with the main branch's GitHub Actions and ensure a smooth collaborative development process for V2 of the QuillCraft server website.
